## Bitcoin with hardware wallets

The best way to safekeep your bitcoin (meaning the best combination of security and usability) is to use a hardware wallet (like [BitBox](https://shiftcrypto.ch/bitbox02){:target="_blank"}, [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com){:target="_blank"} or [Trezor](https://trezor.io){:target="_blank"}) in combination with your own Bitcoin node.
This gives you security, privacy and eliminates the need to trust a third party to verify transactions.

With the RaspiBolt setup, the Bitcoin Core wallet on the node can only be used from the command line as no graphical user interface is installed.
As Bitcoin Core does not offer easy support for hardware wallets quite yet, only a "hot wallet" (exposed to the internet) is possible.

One possibility to use Bitcoin Core with more functionality is to use an Electrum Server as middleware.
It imports data from Bitcoin Core and provides it to software wallets supporting the Electrum protocol.
Wallets like the [BitBoxApp](https://shiftcrypto.ch/app/){:target="_blank"}, [Electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/){:target="_blank"} or [Sparrow Wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/){:target="_blank"} that support hardware wallets can then be used with your own sovereign Bitcoin node.

The installation of your own Electrum server is optional and not essential for running a Lightning node.
It is very much recommended, however, as it is an important step to claim back your on-chain sovereignty and enforce the Bitcoin consensus.
The article "[We need Bitcoin full nodes. Economic ones.](https://shiftcrypto.ch/blog/we-need-bitcoin-full-nodes-economic-ones/){:target="_blank"}" explains why it is pointless to run an idle Bitcoin full node without using it to verify your own on-chain transactions.

## Electrs

An easy and performant way is to run [Electrs](https://github.com/romanz/electrs){:target="_blank"}, the Electrum Server in Rust.
There are no binaries available, so we will compile the application directly from the source code.

### Install dependencies

* Install build tools

  ```sh
  $ sudo apt install cargo clang cmake
  ```

### Build from source code

Now we get the latest release of the Electrs source code, verify it, compile it to an executable binary and install it.
The whole process takes about 30 minutes.

* Download the source code for the latest Electrs release.
  You can check the [release page](https://github.com/romanz/electrs/releases){:target="_blank"} to see if a newer release is available.
  Other releases might not have been properly tested with the rest of the RaspiBolt configuration, though.

  ```sh
  $ mkdir /home/admin/rust
  $ cd /home/admin/rust
  $ git clone --branch v0.9.2 https://github.com/romanz/electrs.git
  $ cd electrs
  ```

* To avoid using bad source code, verify that the release has been properly signed by the main developer [Roman Zeyde](https://github.com/romanz){:target="_blank"}.

  ```sh
  $ curl https://romanzey.de/pgp.txt | gpg --import
  $ git verify-tag v0.9.2
  > gpg: Good signature from "Roman Zeyde <me@romanzey.de>" [unknown]
  > gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
  > gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
  > Primary key fingerprint: 15C8 C357 4AE4 F1E2 5F3F  35C5 87CA E5FA 4691 7CBB
  ```

* Now compile the source code into an executable binary and install it.
  The compilation process can take up to one hour.

  ```sh
  $ cargo build --locked --release
  $ sudo cp ./target/release/electrs /usr/local/bin/
  ```

### Configuration & indexing

* Create the "electrs" service user, which is a member of the "bitcoin" group

  ```sh
  $ sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" electrs
  $ sudo adduser electrs bitcoin
  ```

* Create the Electrs data directory

  ```sh
  $ sudo mkdir /data/electrs
  $ sudo chown -R electrs:electrs /data/electrs
  ```

* Switch to "electrs" user and create config file with the following content.
  Replace `<PasswordB>` with your actual `password [B]`

  ```sh
  $ sudo su - electrs
  $ nano /data/electrs/electrs.conf
  ```

  ```sh
  # RaspiBolt: electrs configuration
  # /data/electrs/electrs.conf

  # Bitcoin Core settings
  network = "bitcoin"
  daemon_dir= "/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin"
  daemon_rpc_addr = "127.0.0.1:8332"
  daemon_p2p_addr = "127.0.0.1:8333"

  # Electrs settings
  electrum_rpc_addr = "127.0.0.1:50001"
  db_dir = "/data/electrs/db"
  index_lookup_limit = 1000

  # Logging
  verbose = 2
  timestamp = true
  ```

* Let's start Electrs manually first, to check if it's running as expected.
  It will immediately start with the initial indexing of the Bitcoin blocks.

  ```sh
  $ electrs --conf /data/electrs/electrs.conf
  ```

  ```sh
  Starting electrs 0.9.2 on aarch64 linux with Config { network: Bitcoin, db_path: "/data/electrs/db/bitcoin", daemon_dir: "/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin", daemon_auth: CookieFile("/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/.cookie"), daemon_rpc_addr: 127.0.0.1:8332, daemon_p2p_addr: 127.0.0.1:8333, electrum_rpc_addr: 127.0.0.1:50001, monitoring_addr: 127.0.0.1:4224, wait_duration: 10s, jsonrpc_timeout: 15s, index_batch_size: 10, index_lookup_limit: Some(1000), reindex_last_blocks: 0, auto_reindex: true, ignore_mempool: false, sync_once: false, disable_electrum_rpc: false, server_banner: "Welcome to electrs 0.9.2 (Electrum Rust Server)!", args: [] }

  ```

* Stop Electrs with `Ctrl`-`C` and exit the "electrs" user session.

  ```sh
  $ exit
  ```

### Autostart on boot

Electrs needs to start automatically on system boot.

* As user "admin", create the Electrs systemd unit and copy/paste the following configuration. Save and exit.

  ```sh
  $ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/electrs.service
  ```

  ```sh
  # RaspiBolt: systemd unit for electrs
  # /etc/systemd/system/electrs.service

  [Unit]
  Description=Electrs daemon
  Wants=bitcoind.service
  After=bitcoind.service

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  ```

* Enable and start Electrs.

  ```sh
  $ sudo systemctl enable electrs
  $ sudo systemctl start electrs
  ```

* Check the systemd journal to see Electrs' log output.

  ```sh
  $ sudo journalctl -f -u electrs
  ```

  Electrs will now index the whole Bitcoin blockchain so that it can provide all necessary information to wallets.
  With this, the wallets you use no longer need to connect to any third-party server to communicate with the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network.

* Exit the log output with `Ctrl`-`C`

---

## Secure communication

In the [Security section](security.md), we already set up NGINX as a reverse proxy.
Now we can add the Electrs configuration.

* Create Electrs configuration file for NGINX, and paste the following content

  ```sh
  $ sudo nano /etc/nginx/streams-enabled/electrs-reverse-proxy.conf
  ```
  ```nginx
  upstream electrs {
    server 127.0.0.1:50001;
  }

  server {
    listen 50002 ssl;
    proxy_pass electrs;
  }
  ```

* Test the NGINX configuration and restart the service

  ```sh
  $ sudo nginx -t
  $ sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```

* Open port 50002 in UFW to accept incoming connections

  ```sh
  $ sudo ufw allow 50002 comment 'allow Electrum SSL'
  ```

### Remote access

To use your Electrum server when you're on the go, you can easily create a Tor hidden service.
This way, you can connect the BitBoxApp or Electrum wallet also remotely, or even share the connection details with friends and family.
Note that the remote device needs to have Tor installed.

* Add the following three lines in the section for "location-hidden services" in the `torrc` file.

  ```sh
  $ sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
  ```

  ```sh
  ############### This section is just for location-hidden services ###
  HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_electrs/
  HiddenServiceVersion 3
  HiddenServicePort 50002 127.0.0.1:50002
  ```

* Restart Tor and get your connection address.

  ```sh
  $ sudo systemctl restart tor
  $ sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_electrs/hostname
  > gwdllz5g7vky2q4gr45zGuvopjzf33czreca3a3exosftx72ekppkuqd.onion
  ```
